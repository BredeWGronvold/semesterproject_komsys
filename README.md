# semesterproject_komsys

This is a prototype of the system we are preseting in the course TTM 41115.
The system is small, although the functionalities stated in Systemspec. 3 is included in this system.

How the program works: 
Execute the python notebook files at the same time, server.ipynb, student.ipynb (it is optional to execute both student notebooks), ta.ipynb.
A small UI will appear underneath the code, the student file's UI includes a few buttons which allows the user to interact with the system.
By "delivering" the tasks, the system will create a file with today's data as name which contains the submitted answers.
